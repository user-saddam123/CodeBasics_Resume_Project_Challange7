## Project Overview

Telangana is one of the fastest-growing states in India, and it has an open data policy. This means that all of the state's data is published online, making it easy to analyze and identify trends.

Our stakeholders wanted us to analyze Telangana's growth among different sectors quantitatively and provide useful insights to the Telangana government. This would help them to make data-informed decisions that would further support the growth of the state.

## Tools Used:
  *  𝑬𝒙𝒄𝒆𝒍: To prepare the data for analysis, we used Excel to clean and organize it.

  * 𝑷𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒓 𝑩𝑰: Using the powerful data analysis tool Power BI, we were able to quantitatively analyze Telangana's growth among different sectors and provide useful insights to the Telangana government.

  * 𝑪𝒂𝒏𝒗𝒂: I used Canva to create visually appealing presentations that communicated our findings in a clear and concise way.

  * 𝑶𝑩𝑺 𝑺𝒕𝒖𝒅𝒊𝒐: I used OBS Studio to record videos of our presentations so that we could share them with the Telangana government and a wider audience.

  * 𝑪𝒉𝒂𝒕𝑮𝑷𝑻 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑩𝒂𝒓𝒅: I used CGAT GPT and Bard to help us with our research and analysis.

## Top Insight:
1.  After the implementation of e-stamp, it can be clearly seen thatthe number of e-stamp has increased. The number of document registrations has also increased, but not as significantly as the number of e-Stamp challans.

2. After my analysis I found that these are the top 4 districts where maximum revenue is generated, maximum vehicle
sales , maximum employment generated  and maximum investment has taken place.
      * Rangareddy
      * Medchal_Malkajgiri
      * Hyderabad
      * Sangareddy

3. After my analysis, I found that across Telangana, most people like to buy motorbikes, followed by motorcars, agriculture vehicle, autorickshaw.

4. After my analysis, I found that in Telangana, the fuel type vehicle sales of petrol and diesel have been highest in the month of October and June. Similarly, for electric type and other fuel types, the sales have been highest in the month of March.

5. After my analysis I found that in all over Telangana Nalgonda, Suryapet, Siddipet and Khamam districts have the highest sales of agriculture related vehicles. This makes it possible to say that is agriculture dominated district.

6. After my analysis, I found that in Telangana, Real Estate, Industrial Parks and It Building , Pharmaceuticals and chemicals, Plastics and Rubber , Solar and Other Renewable Energy and Bevrage Sector have highest investments in past 5 fives years.

7. After my analysis, I found that in Telangana, In general, districts with higher vehicle sales also have higher investments and higher stamps revenue. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, Hyderabad is a district with high vehicle sales but low investment.

## Recomendation:
1. After the implementation of e-stamp, it can be clearly seen that the number of e-stamp has increased. But the government should focus more on e-STMAP challan so that the number of document registered challans can not be reduced. Because they are still using more than people document registration.

2. Telangana is a large state with 31 districts, of which 𝟭𝟬 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘁𝘀. The population living in these districts accounts for about 40% of the state's total population. To promote development in rural districts, the Telangana government should take the following measures:
      * Improve infrastructure: Rural districts lack roads, electricity, water, and other basic infrastructure. Improving this infrastructure will boost development in rural areas.
      * Improve education and healthcare: The quality of education and healthcare in rural districts needs to be improved. This will improve the standard of living of people in rural areas.
      * Create employment opportunities: There is a lack of employment opportunities in rural districts. The government should create employment opportunities in the agriculture, industry, and service sectors in rural areas.
      * Implement rural development programs: The government should implement various programs for rural development, such as the :
         * 𝗥𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗲, 
         * 𝗡𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗘𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗚𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗲 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗲 
         * 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶 𝗔𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗬𝗼𝗷𝗮𝗻𝗮.

## Specific Suggetion:
1. Promote e-governance in rural areas. This will make it easier for people in rural areas to access government services.

2. Implement programs for women and children in rural areas. This will improve the standard of living of women and children in rural areas.

3. Implement environmental protection programs in rural areas. This will protect the environment in rural areas.

4. According to my analysis I saw that even after the introduction of electric vehicles, people are still using petrol and diesel vehicles more. which is harmful to the environment that why- suggestions for the Telangana government to reduce the sales of petrol fueled vehicles and encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) to mitigate environmental damage.

5. This time 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗮 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝟮𝟬 𝗺𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴. In which all the member countries together decided that by 2030 they will reduce their dependence on petrol and diesel. For which together every country will do its investment and research on solar energy and renewable energy.

    * But after my analysis I saw that still Telangana gov is making maximum investment every year in real estate, industrial building, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, rubber and plastics sectors its not bad. 
    * But Telangana government should invest maximum in solar energy and renewable energy. 
    * Due to which our environment will also be saved from pollution so that the government does not have to pay extra attention to pollution.
