This challenge has been a thrilling experience, and I'm grateful thanks to codebasics and gov of Telangana for organizing it 🙌.

🅾🆅🅴🆁🆅🅸🅴🆆 🅾🅵 🆃🅷🅸🆂 🅿🆁🅾🅹🅴🅲🆃:
Telangana is one of the fastest-growing states in India 🚀, and it has an open data policy 🔓. This means that all of the state's data is published online, making it easy to analyze and identify trends.

Our stakeholders wanted us to analyze Telangana's growth among different sectors quantitatively and provide useful insights to the Telangana government 🏛️. This would help them to make data-informed decisions that would further support the growth of the state 📈.

🆃🅾🅾🅻🆂 🆄🆂🅴🅳:
Excel, Power BI, Canva, OBS Studio, ChatGPT, and Bard for Telangana's Growth Analysis

🅸🅽🆂🅸🅶🅷🆃🆂:
1. After the implementation of e-stamp, it can be clearly seen thatthe
number of e-stamp has increased. The number of document registrations has also increased, but not as
significantly as the number of e-Stamp challans.

2. After my analysis I found that these are the top 4 districts
where maximum revenue is generated, maximum vehicle
sales , maximum employment generated  and maximum investment has taken place.
      👉🏻Rangareddy
      👉🏻Medchal_Malkajgiri
      👉🏻Hyderabad
      👉🏻Sangareddy

3. After my analysis, I found that across Telangana,
most people like to buy motorbikes, followed by
motorcars, agriculture vehicle, autorickshaw.

4.After my analysis, I found that in Telangana, the fuel
type vehicle sales of petrol and diesel have been
highest in the month of October and June. Similarly,
for electric type and other fuel types, the sales have
been highest in the month of March.

5. After my analysis I found that in all over
Telangana Nalgonda, Suryapet, Siddipet and
Khamam districts have the highest sales of
agriculture related vehicles. This makes it
possible to say that is agriculture dominated
district.

6. After my analysis, I found that in Telangana, Real
Estate, Industrial Parks and It Building ,
Pharmaceuticals and chemicals, Plastics and Rubber ,
Solar and Other Renewable Energy and Bevrage
Sector have highest investments in past 5 fives years.

7. After my analysis, I found that in Telangana, In general, districts with higher vehicle sales
also have higher investments and higher stamps revenue. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, Hyderabad is a district with high vehicle sales but low investment.

𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀:
1.Telangana is a major hub for IT and IT-enabled services (ITES). The state is home to over 1,500 IT and ITES companies, which employ ove 6 lakh people.
2. Telangana is also a major hub for manufacturing. The state is home to a number of large-scale manufacturing industries, such as automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and electronics.
3. Telangana has a young and educated population. The state's literacy rate is over 70%, and the median age is 27 years.
4. Telangana has a favorable investment climate. The state government has implemented a number of policies and initiatives to attract investment, such as TS-iPASS and e-stamping.
5. Telangana is well-positioned to benefit from the growing global demand for sustainable products and services. The state has a number of natural resources, such as solar and wind energy, that can be used to produce sustainable energy.
6. Telangana is a major tourist destination. The state is home to a number of historical and cultural attractions, such as the Charminar and Golconda Fort, etc.

🆁🅴🅲🅾🅼🅼🅴🅽🅳🅰🆃🅸🅾🅽:
1. After the implementation of e-stamp, it can be clearly seen that the number of e-stamp has increased. But the government should focus more on e-STMAP challan so that the number of document registered challans can not be reduced. Because they are still using more than people document registration.

2.Telangana is a large state with 31 districts, of which 𝟭𝟬 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘁𝘀. The population living in these districts accounts for about 40% of the state's total population. To promote development in rural districts, the Telangana government should take the following measures:
         👉🏻Improve infrastructure: Rural districts lack roads, electricity, water, and other basic infrastructure. Improving this infrastructure will boost development in rural areas.
         👉🏻Improve education and healthcare: The quality of education and healthcare in rural districts needs to be improved. This will improve the standard of living of people in rural areas.
         👉🏻Create employment opportunities: There is a lack of employment opportunities in rural districts. The government should create employment opportunities in the agriculture, industry, and service sectors in rural areas.
         👉🏻Implement rural development programs: The government should implement various programs for rural development, such as the 𝗥𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗲, the 𝗡𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗘𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗚𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗲 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗲, and the 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗶 𝗔𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗬𝗼𝗷𝗮𝗻𝗮.
𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰 𝘀𝘂𝗴𝗴𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀:
✨Promote e-governance in rural areas. This will make it easier for people in rural areas to access government services.
✨Implement programs for women and children in rural areas. This will improve the standard of living of women and children in rural areas.
✨Implement environmental protection programs in rural areas. This will protect the environment in rural areas

3. According to my analysis I saw that even after the introduction of electric vehicles, people are still using petrol and diesel vehicles more. which is harmful to the environment that why- suggestions for the Telangana government to reduce the sales of petrol fueled vehicles and encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) to mitigate environmental damage.

4. This time 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗮 𝘄𝗮𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝟮𝟬 𝗺𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴. In which all the member countries together decided that by 2030 they will reduce their dependence on petrol and diesel. For which together every country will do its investment and research on solar energy and renewable energy.
But after my analysis I saw that still Telangana gov is making maximum investment every year in real estate, industrial building, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, rubber and plastics sectors its not bad. But Telangana government should invest maximum in solar energy and renewable energy. Due to which our environment will also be saved from pollution so that the government does not have to pay extra attention to pollution.

𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:
1. Invest in research and development: The government should invest in research and development to promote innovation and technological advancement. This will help Telangana to develop new industries and compete globally.
2. Develop a digital economy: The government should support the development of a digital economy by providing access to affordable broadband and by promoting the use of digital technologies.
3. Promote e-governance: The government should promote e-governance to make it easier for citizens and businesses to access government services.
4. Be transparent and accountable: The government should be transparent and accountable to its citizens. The government should also be responsive to the needs of its citizens.
5. Promote entrepreneurship: The government should promote entrepreneurship by providing financial assistance and other support to startups. The government should also create a culture of innovation and risk-taking.
6. Support the services sector: The government should support the growth of the services sector, such as IT, tourism, and financial services. The government should also invest in education and training to create a skilled workforce for the services sector.

✨I provided these insights to the Telangana government in a comprehensive report. We also made recommendations on how the government could use this data to make even better decisions about the state's future growth and development.

✨I am confident that my research and recommendation will help the Telangana government to continue its impressive growth trajectory and become one of the leading states in India.
